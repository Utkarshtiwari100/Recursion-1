This problem has only one correct answer

Compilation Error
Runtime Error 
5
None of these

Correct Answer : Runtime Error 
Solution Description
Since the base case is missing in the code, therefore there will be infinite recursion calls and hence runtime error will occur.

Correct Answer : Runtime Error

Solution Description
In function print when recursion call is being made  n-- is being passed as input. Here we are using post decrement operator, so argument passed to next function call is n and not n - 1. Thus there will be infinite recursion calls and runtime error will come.
